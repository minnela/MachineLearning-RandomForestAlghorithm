# MachineLearning-RandomForestAlghorithm
Random Forest is a flexible, easy to use machine learning algorithm that produces, even without hyper-parameter tuning, a great result most of the time. It is also one of the most used algorithms, because itâ€™s simplicity and the fact that it can be used for both classification and regression tasks.
